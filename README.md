### Who's there?

Knock-Knock is here to guess who might be at the door. Knock-Knock takes user input and attempts to interject the answer to the knock-knock jokes before you can. How rude.

## User Stories
* User opens the page and clicks on a 'Knock-Knock' button to intiate interaction: "Knock, Knock", "Who's there?", __________
* User inputs the first response and the site returns a guess as to how the joke might finish.
* If the computer response is incorrect, it will try one additional guess.
* If both are incorrect, the user is prompted to submit the correct answer, which is then added to the knock knock jokes database.
